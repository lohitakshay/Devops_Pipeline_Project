# Devops_Pipeline_Project

Welcome to my personal project repository for DevOps pipeline automation! This repository showcases my work on creating a robust CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and various DevOps tools.

## Project Overview

In this project, I have designed and implemented a comprehensive DevOps pipeline that integrates multiple stages, including code checkout, build, test, security scanning, quality analysis, Docker image management, and Kubernetes deployment. The pipeline leverages various tools and plugins to ensure efficient and secure software delivery.

## Key Features

- **Jenkins Pipeline**: Automated CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins for continuous integration and delivery.
- **Maven Integration**: Built with Maven for project management and build automation.
- **SonarQube Analysis**: Integrated SonarQube for code quality and security analysis.
- **Docker Integration**: Docker image building, scanning, and publishing.
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Deployment to a Kubernetes cluster with dynamic scaling.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Devops_Pipeline_Self_Project.git

Install Dependencies:

Ensure Jenkins is installed and running.
Install necessary Jenkins plugins (e.g., Eclipse Temurin Installer, Pipeline Maven Integration, SonarQube Scanner, Docker, Kubernetes).
Configure Jenkins:

Set up Jenkins tools (JDK, Maven, SonarQube Scanner).
Configure credentials and tools in Jenkins global settings.
Create and Configure Pipeline:

Create a new pipeline job in Jenkins.
Copy the pipeline script from the Jenkinsfile in this repository and paste it into the pipeline script section of the Jenkins job.
Usage
Run the Pipeline:

Trigger the Jenkins job to start the pipeline.
Monitor the stages from code checkout to deployment and review the results.
Customize the Pipeline:

Modify the pipeline script to fit your project's needs.
Update Docker image names, deployment configurations, and other parameters as required.
