# Devops_Pipeline_Project

Welcome to my personal project repository for DevOps pipeline automation! This repository showcases my work on creating a robust CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and various DevOps tools.

## Project Overview

In this project, I have designed and implemented a comprehensive DevOps pipeline that integrates multiple stages, including code checkout, build, test, security scanning, quality analysis, Docker image management, and Kubernetes deployment. The pipeline leverages various tools and plugins to ensure efficient and secure software delivery.

## Key Features

- **Jenkins Pipeline**: Automated CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins for continuous integration and delivery.
- **Maven Integration**: Built with Maven for project management and build automation.
- **SonarQube Analysis**: Integrated SonarQube for code quality and security analysis.
- **Docker Integration**: Docker image building, scanning, and publishing.
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Deployment to a Kubernetes cluster with dynamic scaling.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Devops_Pipeline_Self_Project.git

## Install Dependencies
Ensure Jenkins is installed and running on your system. You will also need to install the following Jenkins plugins:

### Eclipse Temurin Installer:

- Enables Jenkins to automatically install and configure the Eclipse Temurin JDK.
- Go to Jenkins Dashboard -> Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugins -> Available tab.
- Search for "Eclipse Temurin Installer" and install it.

### Pipeline Maven Integration:

- Provides Maven support for Jenkins Pipeline.
- Install it from the Jenkins Plugin Manager.

### Config File Provider:

- Allows you to define and manage configuration files centrally.
- Install it from the Jenkins Plugin Manager.

### SonarQube Scanner:

- Integrates Jenkins with SonarQube for code analysis.
- Install it from the Jenkins Plugin Manager.

### Kubernetes CLI:

- Enables Jenkins to interact with Kubernetes clusters using kubectl.
- Install it from the Jenkins Plugin Manager.

### Kubernetes:

- Integrates Jenkins with Kubernetes for dynamic agent provisioning.
- Install it from the Jenkins Plugin Manager.

### Docker:

- Allows Jenkins to interact with Docker for building and managing images.
- Install it from the Jenkins Plugin Manager.

### Docker Pipeline Step:

- Extends Jenkins Pipeline with Docker container management steps.
- Install it from the Jenkins Plugin Manager.

## Configure Jenkins

### Set Up Jenkins Tools:

- Configure Jenkins to use JDK, Maven, and SonarQube Scanner.
- Go to Jenkins Dashboard -> Manage Jenkins -> Global Tool Configuration.
- Add the necessary tools and configure their paths.

### Configure Credentials:

- Add credentials for Git, Docker, SonarQube, and Kubernetes.
- Go to Jenkins Dashboard -> Manage Jenkins -> Manage Credentials.
- Add credentials for each tool with the appropriate IDs.
- Create and Configure Pipeline

### Create a New Pipeline Job:

- Go to Jenkins Dashboard -> New Item.
- Select "Pipeline" and enter a name for your job.

### Add Pipeline Script:

- In the Pipeline section of the job configuration, paste the pipeline script from the Jenkinsfile in this repository.

## Usage
### Run the Pipeline
- Trigger the Jenkins job to start the pipeline.
- Monitor the stages from code checkout to deployment and review the results in Jenkins.
### Customize the Pipeline
- Modify the pipeline script as needed for your project.
- Update Docker image names, deployment configurations, and other parameters according to your requirements. other parameters as required.
